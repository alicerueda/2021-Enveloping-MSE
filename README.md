# Minimum Spline Enveloping
MSE is designed to envelop nonlinear and non-stationary pathological voice such as Parkinson's DDK utterance. The envelopes allows well-received handcraft features to be extracted on edge devices for continuous monitoring. MSE is fast, accurate and low computationally intensive.

MSE selected a subset of maxima as targets to form the upper signal envolope through cubic spline interpolation. There are two variations of MSE, restriction on distance (MSE-D) and restrictionon slope (MSE-S). The encryped MATLAB files were used in creating the MSE envelope in the PC-GITA /pa-ta-ka/ DDK recording.
